<p>Now that you're on this page, I think it'd be best if I gave you some info on myself...</p>

<p>I'm a Computer Science student, with interests ranging from coding (Ruby, Javascript, Java and Go) to philosophy of technology and education.</p>

<h3>
<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>To see some of my code "in the wild", check out the projects listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://sciencechallenges.nl/"><strong>Sciencechallenges</strong></a> is a platform to support the Challenges initiative. It's a student initiative at Twente University to enhance education by challenging students to participate in academic challenges. You can also view the code (it's open-source!) on <a href="https://github.com/boersmamarcel/challengesplatform">GitHub</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://bcleenders.github.io/AI-tic-tac-toe-browser/"><strong>AI tick-tack-toe bot</strong></a> I wrote this as a small proof of concept, to show how easy it is to teach a computer simple tasks. Beware: here be dragons! I did not waste my time optimizing the code, so the results are not as good as they could have been...</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/bcleenders/norvig-award"><strong>Norvig Web Data Science Award submission</strong></a> A program I wrote with one of my fellow students as a submission for a big data contest organized by SURFsara and Common Crawl. When I participated, I was a second-year student and hadn't had a single course on big data yet: everything you see was taught with YouTube and man-pages.</li>
