          abstract = {Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) allows a client to store encrypted data on a storage provider in such a way, that the client is able to search and retrieve the data selectively without the storage provider learning the contents of the data or the words being searched for. Practical SSE schemes usually leak (sensitive) information during or after a query (e.g., the search pattern). Secure schemes on the other hand are not practical, namely they are neither efficient in the computational search complexity, nor scalable with large data sets. To achieve efficiency and security at the same time, we introduce the concept of distributed SSE (DSSE), which uses a query proxy in addition to the storage provider.
We give a construction that combines an inverted index approach (for efficiency) with scrambling functions used in private information retrieval (PIR) (for security). The proposed scheme, which is entirely based on XOR operations and pseudo-random functions, is efficient and does not leak the search pattern. For instance, a secure search in an index over one million documents and 500 keywords is executed in less than 1 second.},
