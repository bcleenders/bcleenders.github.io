{"name":"Bcleenders.github.io","tagline":"Github page","body":"###Hello, world!\r\n\r\nNow that you're on this page, I think it'd be best if I gave you some info on myself...\r\n\r\nI'm a Computer Science student, with interests ranging from coding (Ruby, Javascript, Java and Go) to philosophy of technology and education.\r\n\r\n###Projects\r\nTo see some of my code \"in the wild\", check out the projects listed below:\r\n* [**Sciencechallenges**](http://sciencechallenges.nl/) is a platform to support the Challenges initiative. It's a student initiative at Twente University to enhance education by challenging students to participate in academic challenges. You can also view the code (it's open-source!) on [GitHub](https://github.com/boersmamarcel/challengesplatform)\r\n* [**AI tick-tack-toe bot**](http://bcleenders.github.io/AI-tic-tac-toe-browser/) I wrote this as a small proof of concept, to show how easy it is to teach a computer simple tasks. Beware: here be dragons! I did not waste my time optimizing the code, so the results are not as good as they could have been...\r\n* [**Norvig Web Data Science Award submission**](https://github.com/bcleenders/norvig-award) A program I wrote with one of my fellow students as a submission for a big data contest organized by SURFsara and Common Crawl. When I participated, I was a second-year student and hadn't had a single course on big data yet: everything you see was taught with YouTube and man-pages.\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me by [mail](mailto:bcleenders@gmail.com) or to look me up on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bram-leenders/42/1b0/275).\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-48541532-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
